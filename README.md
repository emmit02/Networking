Java Networking: Client and Server Example
Welcome to the Java Networking: Client and Server project! This repository contains a comprehensive example of how to implement basic networking functionalities using Java, showcasing both client and server roles.

📚 Overview
In the world of networking, understanding the interaction between clients and servers is crucial. This project demonstrates how to create a simple client-server architecture in Java, allowing you to grasp the fundamentals of network communication.

🖥️ Key Features
Server Implementation: A basic server that listens for client connections and processes requests.
Client Implementation: A client that connects to the server, sends requests, and receives responses.
Multi-threading: The server can handle multiple client connections simultaneously using multi-threading.
Data Exchange: Simple protocols for exchanging messages between the client and server.
📁 Project Structure
files/: Contains the source code for both the client and server implementations.
Client.java: Implements the client-side application.
Server.java: Implements the server-side application.

🚀 Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
https://github.com/emmit02/Networking.git
cd java-networking-client-server
Compile the source code:

bash
Copy code
javac /*.java
Run the server:

bash
Copy code
java /Server
Run the client:

bash
Copy code
java /Client

🛠️ Usage
Server: The server will start and listen on a specified port for client connections. It will handle incoming client requests and send appropriate responses.
Client: The client will connect to the server, send a request, and display the server's response.

🌟 Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Please ensure your code adheres to the existing style and includes relevant tests.

📝 Acknowledgments
Inspired by the need to understand the fundamental client-server model in networking, this project serves as a starting point for those new to network programming in Java.
